# Cynthia-Ugwu-FrontEnd-

Structure: Built with clean and semantic HTML5 to organize sections like header, main content, and footer.

Styling: Designed with custom CSS for a bold, minimalistic, high-contrast look (typical of Cynthia Ugwu’s aesthetic).

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is heavily used for smooth, eye-catching entrance animations, scroll effects, and hover interactions.

Navigation: Custom animated menu transitions (e.g., sliding menus, fluid hover states) handled with JavaScript and GSAP.

Typography: Large, dramatic fonts with tight tracking (letter spacing) and significant line heights to give a strong visual impact.

Cursor Effects: Custom cursor using JavaScript — like magnetic buttons, hover enlargements, and trail effects.

Image Handling: Images animated on load and hover (e.g., scale up, distort, parallax effects), also powered by GSAP.

Page Transitions: Smooth page transitions (like fade in/out or wipe animations) instead of traditional hard reloads.

JavaScript Logic: Vanilla JavaScript used for basic DOM manipulation and event handling, with GSAP boosting animation capabilities.

Responsiveness: Not responsive — the layout breaks or overflows on smaller screens; optimized only for large desktops.

Performance: Medium-heavy due to high animation usage; smooth on powerful devices but may lag on older systems.
